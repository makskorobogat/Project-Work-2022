# Project-Work-2022
This is design work that was done from 1/2022 to 6/2022.

The programming languages used were C/C++ to receive (and send) data from the Siemens controller and Python to create an interface to interact with the pumping unit. 

The main language in the project is Python, but C was used to write the data transfer program. The program from C was then converted to Python in order to have a single program

To start the program you need to run gui.py file. 

And also don't forget to download and install some libraries: sklearn, pandas and dearpygui

To install a new framework just write that in console "pip install [Name of library]". 

For example: "pip install sklearn"
